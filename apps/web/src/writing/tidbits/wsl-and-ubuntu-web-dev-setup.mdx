I have been using Windows + WSL2 (Ubuntu) for my web development environment for many years now.  
Over time I gathered some helpful resources for setting up such development environment, so I decided
to write this post to have a reference for myself and you, dear reader!

It shows how to set up

- WSL and Ubuntu itself
- git-related tooling
- prerequisites to be able to install, build, etc. codebases using the Node.js ecosystem
- pnpm
- Docker
- VS Code
- and, optionally, additional things

## Basic setup for WSL

1. Open PowerShell as administrator and run:

   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```

1. Restart your machine.
1. Run "Ubuntu" from the start menu to start an Ubuntu terminal.
1. It will ask for a username and password - choose some.
1. I like to not having to enter the password when running things in the WSL distribution, do the following to remove it:

   1. Run:

      ```sh
      sudo visudo
      ```

   1. At the bottom of the file, add the following line (replace `<username>` with your chosen username):

      ```txt
      <username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
      ```

   1. Press `CTRL+X` to exit nano and it will prompt you to save.
   1. Close the terminal and start a new one (by running "Ubuntu" from the start menu).

1. Update and upgrade all packages:

   ```sh
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
   ```

### Ensure reliable network connection for WSL

Sometimes after I have set up WSL it had strange network issues for outbound connections.  
 I found some GitHub issues regarding that and one of them mentioned a misconfigured network interface.  
 That's why nowadays I always do the following one time after setting up WSL (based on <FancyAnchor href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/7254#issuecomment-1202299443">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>):

1. Start PowerShell as administrator.
1. List the network interfaces of Windows:

   ```powershell
   netsh interface ipv4 show subinterfaces
   ```

1. There should be an interface called `"vEthernet (WSL)"`. Also you must have some WiFi interface, in my case it is called `"WiFi"`. Both interfaces should have the same "MTU" value.  
   If not, run this:

   ```powershell
   netsh interface ipv4 set subinterface "vEthernet (WSL)" mtu=<MTU-value-of-wifi-interface> store=persistent
   wsl --shutdown
   ```

## Git and GitHub SSH

1. Update git to the latest version and add support for git LFS:

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install git
   sudo apt-get install git-lfs
   git lfs install
   ```

1. Configure git:

   ```sh
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
   ```

1. Create a SSH keypair and add the private key to ssh-agent in Ubuntu (based on <FancyAnchor href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent?platform=linux">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>):

   ```sh
   # Generate a SSH keypair
   # When asked for a passphrase, I typically omit that.
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com" -f "~/.ssh/id_rsa_github"

   # Start the ssh-agent in the background
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

   # Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent
   ssh-add "~/.ssh/id_rsa_github"

   # Configure the key for github.com in the SSH config file
   printf "Host github.com\n    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github" >> ~/.ssh/config

   # copy the public key into Windows clipboard
   cat "~/.ssh/id_rsa_github.pub" | clip.exe
   ```

1. Add the public key of your new SSH keypair to your GitHub account (note: you must check out the GitHub repositories via SSH then, not via HTTPS):

   1. Open <FancyAnchor href="https://github.com/settings/ssh/new">Add new SSH key of your GitHub settings</FancyAnchor>
   1. _Title:_ I recommend to combine the name of your PC with "WSL", like `ZEPHYRUS-M16 WSL`.
   1. _Key type:_ Keep `Authentication Key`
   1. _Key:_ Use the content of the clipboard (= the public key).

## Node.js and C/C++ compiler tool chain

1. Instead of installing Node.js directly I like to use `nvm` to be able to have multiple versions of Node.js installed at the same time (you can read more here: <FancyAnchor href="https://pkerschbaum.com/tidbits/multiple-vs-code-instances-with-separate-nodejs-versions">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>).  
   Run this to install `nvm`:

   ```sh
   # replace v0.39.3 by the newest version
   # you can look it up here: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/releases
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
   ```

1. To be able to compile npm packages which include native C++ addons, via `node-gyp`, we need to install a few things:

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install build-essential g++ libx11-dev libxkbfile-dev libsecret-1-dev python-is-python3
   ```

1. npm has a feature to complete commands via the tab key, so let's enable that:

   ```sh
   npm completion >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

1. If you want to automatically switch the Node.js version when you enter a directory with a `.nvmrc` file, you can run the code below in bash to add a hook to your `.bashrc`:

   ```bash
   cat >> ~/.bashrc <<- EOM

   # start: run-nvm-use-if-cwd-has-nvmrc-file
   # run "nvm use" automatically on directory change if a file ".nvmrc" is present in the new directory (https://stackoverflow.com/a/48322289/1700319)
   _nvmrc_hook() {
      if [[ $PWD == $PREV_PWD ]]; then
         return
      fi

      PREV_PWD=$PWD
      [[ -f ".nvmrc" ]] && nvm use
   }

   if ! [[ "${PROMPT_COMMAND:-}" =~ _nvmrc_hook ]]; then
      PROMPT_COMMAND="_nvmrc_hook${PROMPT_COMMAND:+;$PROMPT_COMMAND}"
   fi
   # end: run-nvm-use-if-cwd-has-nvmrc-file
   EOM
   ```

## pnpm

- To install pnpm, follow <FancyAnchor href="https://pnpm.io/installation">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor> and <FancyAnchor href="https://pnpm.io/completion">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>.
- To just use `p` to run `pnpm`, add the following to your `.bashrc`:

  ```bash
  cat >> ~/.bashrc <<- EOM

  # start: pnpm-alias
  alias p='pnpm'
  # end: pnpm-alias
  EOM
  ```

## Docker

Choose one of the following:

- _Docker Desktop:_ This is the recommended option because everything just works.
  - <FancyAnchor href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>
  - But be aware of the licensing terms, see "Who's required to pay for Docker Desktop?" in <FancyAnchor href="https://www.docker.com/pricing/faq/">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>.
- _Install Docker directly in WSL Ubuntu:_ Drawbacks are that there is no support for starting containers from Windows directly and multi-platform builds are not possible with this option.
  - Docker Setup for Ubuntu: <FancyAnchor href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>
  - In case there is some permission error `/var/run/docker.sock` see <FancyAnchor href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/52245490">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>.

### Dockerfile linting via `hadolint`

- Install [`hadolint`](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint):

  ```sh
  # replace v2.10.0 by the newest version
  # you can look it up here: https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/releases
  wget -O /bin/hadolint https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/releases/download/v2.10.0/hadolint-Linux-x86_64
  sudo chmod 777 /usr/bin/hadolint
  ```

- If you use VS Code, install the hadolint extension: <FancyAnchor href="https://github.com/michaellzc/vscode-hadolint">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>.

### Docker multi-architecture builds

Set up a multi-architecture Docker builder for cross-platform builds:

```sh
# from https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/748634
docker buildx create --use --platform=linux/arm64,linux/amd64 --name multi-platform-builder
docker buildx inspect --bootstrap
```

## VS Code

- Install the <FancyAnchor href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl">WSL extension</FancyAnchor>, then you can run in an Ubuntu terminal `code .` to start VS Code in that folder.

  VS Code will inherit all environment variables from the WSL terminal, and `nvm` uses environment variables to switch Node.js versions.  
  As a consequence, VS Code started this way will under-the-hood use the exact version of Node.js you want to use for the project, allowing e.g. git hooks invoked by VS Code to work correctly.

  I use scripts like below to quickly start development:

  ```bash
  alias pkerschbaum_dev='cd ~/workspace/pkerschbaum-homepage && nvm use && code .'
  ```

## Additional things

- [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/?os=linux) is a great tool to expose a local server to the internet (e.g. to open the web application you work on on your mobile phone).
- To sync the bash history between terminals, run the following in the Ubuntu terminal to add it to your `.bashrc`:

  ```bash
  cat >> ~/.bashrc <<- EOM

  # start: sync-bash-history
  # sync history between terminals, https://subbass.blogspot.com/2009/10/howto-sync-bash-history-between.html
  shopt -s histappend
  PROMPT_COMMAND="history -n; history -a"
  unset HISTFILESIZE
  HISTSIZE=2000
  # end: sync-bash-history
  EOM
  ```

- Certain Node.js and Ubuntu combinations can lead to errors when Node.js `crypto` APIs are used.
  In case you get an error along the lines `error:25066067:DSO support routines:dlfcn_load:could not load the shared library` when running Node.js code you can do this: <FancyAnchor href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/1409458/openssl-config-cuases-error-in-node-js-crypto-how-should-the-config-be-updated/1410124#1410124">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>.
- If there are connection issues (even after fixing the MTU value of the WSL network interface, what we did above) you might need to change the DNS server: <FancyAnchor href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/7254#issuecomment-905767204">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>.
- Some WSL tips:

  - Run `explorer.exe .` in an Ubuntu terminal to open the Windows Explorer at that directory path.
  - Run `echo "hello world" | clip.exe` to copy "hello world" to the Windows clipboard.
  - Run `wsl --shutdown` in Windows CMD or PowerShell to shutdown the WSL instance.
