description: A guide for how to set up a Windows+WSL2 development environment for the Node.js ecosystem.

I have been using Windows + WSL2 for my web development environment for many years now.  
Over time I gathered some helpful resources for setting up such development environment, so I decided
to write this post to have a reference for myself and you, dear reader!

It shows how to set up

- WSL itself
- git-related tooling
- prerequisites to be able to install, build, etc. codebases using the Node.js ecosystem
- and, optionally, additional things

## Basic setup

1. Open PowerShell as administrator and run:

   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```

1. Restart your machine.
1. Run "Ubuntu" from the start menu to start an Ubuntu terminal.
1. It will ask for a username and password - choose some.
1. I like to not having to enter the password when running things in the WSL distribution, do the following to remove it:

   1. Run:

      ```sh
      sudo visudo
      ```

   1. At the bottom of the file, add the following line (replace `<username>` with your chosen username):

      ```txt
      <username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
      ```

   1. Press `CTRL+X` to exit nano and it will prompt you to save.
   1. Close the terminal and start a new one (by running "Ubuntu" from the start menu).

1. Update and upgrade all packages:

   ```sh
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
   ```

## Git and GitHub SSH

1. Update git to the latest version and add support for git LFS:

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install git
   sudo apt-get install git-lfs
   git lfs install
   ```

1. Configure git:

   ```sh
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
   ```

1. Create a SSH keypair and add the private key to ssh-agent in Ubuntu (based on <FancyAnchor href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent?platform=linux">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>):

   ```sh
   # Generate a SSH keypair
   # When asked to enter a file to save the key, I recommend to choose a different filename.
   # For GitHub instead of "/home/pkerschbaum/.ssh/id_rsa" I would choose "/home/pkerschbaum/.ssh/id_rsa_github"
   # When asked for a passphrase, I typically omit that.
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

   # Start the ssh-agent in the background
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

   # Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent
   ssh-add "/home/pkerschbaum/.ssh/id_rsa_github"

   # copy the public key in Windows clipboard
   cat "/home/pkerschbaum/.ssh/id_rsa_github.pub" | clip.exe
   ```

1. Add the public key of your new SSH keypair to your GitHub account (note: you must check out the GitHub repositories via SSH then, not via HTTPS):

   1. Open <FancyAnchor href="https://github.com/settings/ssh/new">Add new SSH key of your GitHub settings</FancyAnchor>
   1. _Title:_ I recommend to combine the name of your PC with "WSL", like `ZEPHYRUS-M16 WSL`.
   1. _Key type:_ Keep `Authentication Key`
   1. _Key:_ Use the content of the clipboard (= the public key).

1. Sometimes after I have set up WSL it had strange network issues for outbound connections.  
   I found some GitHub issues regarding that and one of them mentioned a misconfigured network interface.  
   That's why nowadays I always do the following one time after setting up WSL (based on <FancyAnchor href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/7254#issuecomment-1202299443">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>):

   1. Start PowerShell as administrator.
   1. List the network interfaces of Windows:

      ```powershell
      netsh interface ipv4 show subinterfaces
      ```

   1. There should be an interface called `"vEthernet (WSL)"`. Also you must have some WiFi interface, in my case it is called `"WiFi"`. Both interfaces should have the same "MTU" value.  
      If not, run this:

      ```powershell
      netsh interface ipv4 set subinterface "vEthernet (WSL)" mtu=<MTU-value-of-wifi-interface> store=persistent
      wsl --shutdown
      ```

## Node.js (and related tools)

1. Instead of installing Node.js directly I like to use `nvm` to be able to have multiple versions of Node.js installed at the same time (you can read more here: <FancyAnchor href="https://pkerschbaum.com/tidbits/multiple-vs-code-instances-with-separate-nodejs-versions">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>).  
   Run this to install `nvm`:

   ```sh
   # replace v0.39.3 by the newest version, you can look it up here: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/releases
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
   ```

1. To be able to compile npm packages which include native C++ addons, via `node-gyp`, we need to install a few things:

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install build-essential g++ libx11-dev libxkbfile-dev libsecret-1-dev python-is-python3
   ```

1. npm has a feature to complete commands via the tab key, so let's enable that:

   ```sh
   npm completion >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

## Additional things

- **pnpm:** To install pnpm, follow <FancyAnchor href="https://pnpm.io/installation">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor> and <FancyAnchor href="https://pnpm.io/completion">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>.
- **Docker:** Choose one of the following:

  - _Docker Desktop:_ This is the recommended option because everything just works.
    - <FancyAnchor href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>
    - But be aware of the licensing terms, see "Who's required to pay for Docker Desktop?" in <FancyAnchor href="https://www.docker.com/pricing/faq/">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>.
  - _Install Docker directly in WSL Ubuntu:_ Drawbacks are that there is no support for starting containers from Windows directly and multi-platform builds are not possible with this option.
    - Docker Setup for Ubuntu: <FancyAnchor href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>
    - In case there is some permission error `/var/run/docker.sock` see <FancyAnchor href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/52245490">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>.

  Also recommended:

  - Install hadolint:

    ```sh
    # replace v2.10.0 by the newest version, you can look it up here: https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/releases
    wget -O /bin/hadolint https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/releases/download/v2.10.0/hadolint-Linux-x86_64
    ```

- **VS Code:** Install the <FancyAnchor href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl">WSL extension</FancyAnchor>, then you can run in an Ubuntu terminal `code .` to start VS Code in that folder.
- **Webstorm:** Follow <FancyAnchor href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/how-to-use-wsl-development-environment-in-product.html#ws_wsl_node_interpreter_configure">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>.

- Certain Node.js and Ubuntu combinations can lead to errors when Node.js `crypto` APIs are used.
  In case you get an error along the lines `error:25066067:DSO support routines:dlfcn_load:could not load the shared library` when running Node.js code you can do this: <FancyAnchor href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/1409458/openssl-config-cuases-error-in-node-js-crypto-how-should-the-config-be-updated/1410124#1410124">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>.
- If there are connection issues (even after fixing the MTU value of the WSL network interface, what we did above) you might need to change the DNS server: <FancyAnchor href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/7254#issuecomment-905767204">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>.
- Some tips:

  - Run `explorer.exe .` in an Ubuntu terminal to open the Windows Explorer at that directory path.
  - Run `wsl --shutdown` in Windows CMD or PowerShell to shutdown the WSL instance.
