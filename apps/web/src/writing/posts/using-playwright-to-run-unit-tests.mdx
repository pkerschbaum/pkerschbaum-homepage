I have used Playwright for a couple of my projects so far, and I had such a good experience that it got my E2E test automation tool of choice.

Recently, I started using Playwright Test, the test runner of Playwright ([`@playwright/test`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@playwright/test)) for **unit tests** also.  
This means the test subject **is executed directly in Node.js**; this differs from the "usual" way of using Playwright to open a browser, navigate to a web page, and test that web page in the browser.

In this blog post, I want to

- describe what I like about Playwright and why I think it can be a good choice for unit testing
- outline things missing from Playwright compared to other test frameworks (and how to fill some of those gaps)
- suggest some minor tweaks to make Playwright more suitable for unit tests

## Why to use Playwright Test for unit tests

I had used "traditional" test runners before, mainly Jest, but also Mocha a few years ago.  
I think there are some advantages of using Playwright for unit tests:

- **Same tool for E2E tests and unit tests:**
  One tool less in your setup means one tool less to learn, configure, update, etc.
- **Out-of-the-box support for TypeScript:**
  Playwright Test supports TypeScript _out-of-the-box_.  
  For all other test runners I am aware of you have to configure some transform (Babel, `ts-jest`, etc.), or run the test runner with `ts-node`, or compile the test cases before running them (see e.g. <FancyAnchor href="https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started#using-typescript">"Using Typescript" of the Jest docs</FancyAnchor>).
- **Access to features unique to Playwright:**
  Playwright has some very useful features, e.g.:

  - {/* prettier-ignore */}<FancyAnchor href="https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures">"fixtures"</FancyAnchor> allow to prepare resources per test case on an "opt-in" basis.  
    This is in my opinion much better than the `beforeEach` / `afterEach` fiddling you have to do with other test runners.

    ```typescript
    // base.ts
    import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';
    import * as sinon from 'sinon';

    export const test = base.extend<{ fakeClock: sinon.SinonFakeTimers }>({
      fakeClock: [
        async ({}, use) => {
          const clock = sinon.useFakeTimers();
          await use(clock);
          clock.restore();
        },
        { scope: 'test' },
      ],
    });

    // FILE: bar.spec.ts
    import { test } from './base';

    test('with real clock', ({}) => {
      /*
       * this test case does not use the "fakeClock" fixture,
       * thus the fixture does not get set up
       */
    });
    test('with fake clock', ({ fakeClock }) => {
      /*
       * fake timers will get set up for this test case
       * because "fakeClock" fixture is used
       */
    });
    ```

  - {/* prettier-ignore */}<FancyAnchor href="https://playwright.dev/docs/test-projects">"projects"</FancyAnchor> allow to run "the same or different tests in multiple configurations".  
    For example a while ago I had to make sure that some client/server interaction based on <FancyAnchor href="https://socket.io">socket.io</FancyAnchor> works with both WebSockets and HTTP long-polling.  
    Setting up two Playwright projects with different project parameters allowed me to run the same tests with two configurations, once using WebSockets and once using HTTP long-polling:

    ```typescript
    // playwright.config.ts
    import { PlaywrightTestConfig } from '@playwright/test';

    interface TestOptions {
      transport: 'websocket' | 'polling';
    }

    const config: PlaywrightTestConfig<TestOptions> = {
      projects: [
        {
          name: 'using transport: websocket',
          use: { transport: 'websocket' },
        },
        {
          name: 'using transport: polling',
          use: { transport: 'polling' },
        },
      ],
    };

    export default config;

    // FILE: bar.spec.ts
    import { test } from '@playwright/test';

    test('socket.io connection', ({ transport }) => {
      /*
       * this test case will get run twice,
       * with "transport" set once to "websocket" and once to "polling"
       */
      initializeSocket(transport);
      // ...
    });
    ```

- **Development funded by a big company:**
  Playwright is a product of Microsoft and has been maintained very actively over the last couple of years.
- **No use of globals:** Playwright does not use any globals for its test runner.
  You import from `@playwright/test` just what you need in your test files:

  ```typescript
  // FILE bar.spec.ts
  import { expect, test } from '@playwright/test';

  test.describe('describe title', () => {
    test('test title', ({}) => {
      expect(1 + 1).toEqual(2);
    });
  });
  ```

  Compare that to existing test runners like Jest and Mocha (and Cypress, using Mocha under-the-hood).
  Those test runners set up their test functions as globals (`it`, `expect`, `describe`, `beforeEach` etc.).  
  In TypeScript projects, as soon as you install any two of these test libraries you end up with TypeScript compilation errors, since the types of those functions are usually not compatible with each other.
  There are a couple of workarounds to avoid those compilation errors, for example fiddling with (multiple) `tsconfig.json` files such that types of these libraries are excluded.  
  Cypress even has a guide dedicated to this problem (<FancyAnchor href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/typescript-support#Clashing-types-with-Jest">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>).

  Having the same import statements from `@playwright/test` in every test file might be some boilerplate, but I think the reduced friction (by not having any globals) justifies that boilerplate.  
  Newer test runners like [`vitest`](https://vitest.dev/guide/migration.html#migrating-from-jest) also do not set globals anymore.

## Things missing from Playwright (and how to fill the gaps)

Compared to Jest, there are some things missing from Playwright Test which are often needed when running unit tests.  
Most of those things can be substituted by using libraries of the Node.js ecosystem.  
Take a look at <FancyAnchor href="https://github.com/pkerschbaum/blog-playwright-for-unit-tests_example">the example repository I made</FancyAnchor> to see how to set up those things!

- For **Mocks & Spies** use [`sinon`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sinon) or [`jest-mock`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-mock) (the mocking solution shipped with Jest).
- For **Fake timers** use [`sinon`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sinon) (<FancyAnchor href="https://github.com/pkerschbaum/blog-playwright-for-unit-tests_example/compare/code-coverage...fake-timers">See code changes</FancyAnchor>).
- **Code coverage** just needs a simple combination of the command-line interface [`nyc`](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) of Istanbul (a code coverage tool for JavaScript) and [`source-map-support`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-support) (<FancyAnchor href="https://github.com/pkerschbaum/blog-playwright-for-unit-tests_example/compare/base-setup...code-coverage">See code changes</FancyAnchor>).
- There is experimental support for **Watch mode** at the time of writing, see <FancyAnchor href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/21960#issuecomment-1483604692">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>.  
  Set environment variable `PWTEST_WATCH=1` when running Playwright.
- Some test frameworks provide a way to **mock CommonJS/ECMAScript modules**.  
  Module mocking allows to replace the "thing" returned by `require`/`import` statements by some fake instance.

  Unfortunately, this is not possible in Playwright. Although there are some Node.js libraries that allow module mocking (like [`testdouble`](https://github.com/testdouble/testdouble.js)), they don't work because Playwright does some of the module loading itself (<FancyAnchor href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/14398">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>).  
  If you want to get module mocking support in Playwright, you can upvote this feature request: <FancyAnchor href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/14572">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>.

  This is the biggest downside of using Playwright for unit tests in my opinion.  
  For now, if you want to test modules isolated from others you probably have to adapt the codebase to use some kind of dependency injection.
  Be it that dependencies are just passed as arguments when calling functions, or using a dependency injection solution like <FancyAnchor href="https://docs.nestjs.com/standalone-applications">NestJS IoC containers</FancyAnchor> (which I have used very successfully in the past).

## One last thing

Playwright Test has a method `expect(...).toMatchSnapshot(...)` which can perform snapshot-comparisons on screenshots but also textual and binary data.  
Playwright will append a platform-specific suffix (like `linux`) to the name of the file the snapshot is stored in.
This makes sense for screenshots (since screenshots taken on different platforms will deviate slightly, for example because of text rendering), but it rarely makes sense in case of textual/binary data.

The platform-specific suffix can be removed by setting the <FancyAnchor href="https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-snapshot-path-template">`snapshotPathTemplate`</FancyAnchor> configuration parameter:

```typescript
import { PlaywrightTestConfig } from '@playwright/test';

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  snapshotPathTemplate: '{testDir}/{testFilePath}-snapshots/{arg}{ext}',
};

export default config;
```
