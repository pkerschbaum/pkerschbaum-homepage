You might know <FancyAnchor href="https://prisma.io">Prisma</FancyAnchor>, a collection of products which help to work with databases.  
In a nutshell, you give Prisma a database schema and what you get is a bunch of tools to work with your database.

One of these tools is <FancyAnchor href="https://www.prisma.io/client">Prisma Client</FancyAnchor>, an "intuitive database client for TypeScript and Node.js", as they state it.  
The first time I used Prisma Client, there was something that immediately caught my attention: the way the result type of some APIs react to the input you feed them in.

## A short example using Prisma Client

Imagine we have this simple schema consisting of two models, `User` and `OrgUnit`.  
Those entities have a 1:n relationship, so a `User` is assigned to one `OrgUnit`:

```prisma
model User {
  id    Int
  email String

  orgUnit OrgUnit
}

model OrgUnit {
  id   Int
  name String
}
```

The Prisma Client generated from that schema will allow you to query a `User` by ID.  
The interesting thing is that when doing so, you can include its `OrgUnit`, and **that will change the return type of the function call**:

```typescript
const user = await prisma.user.findUniqueOrThrow({
  where: { id: 1 },
});

/*
  Type of the returned `user` contains the fields of the schema model `User`:
    {
      id: number;
      email: string;
    }
 */

const user = await prisma.user.findUniqueOrThrow({
  where: { id: 1 },
  include: { orgUnit: true }, // <-- including the `orgUnit` here
});

/*
  Type of the returned `user` now includes the `orgUnit` with its properties!
    {
      id: number;
      email: string;
    } & {
      orgUnit: {
        id: number;
        name: string;
      };
    }
 */
```

The main thing to note here is that

- only when `include: { orgUnit: true }` is added to the **function argument**
- `orgUnit` with all of its properties will be present in the **return type**.

This can get pretty wild; Prisma allows you to nest such `include`'s, so you can perform "deep" reads from your database, with multiple layers of joins.  
Also, you can use `select` to get only a subset of the properties of the `OrgUnit`.  
And all the time the result type will reflect _exactly_ what you will get from the database!

```typescript
const user = await prisma.user.findUniqueOrThrow({
  where: { id: 1 },
  include: {
    orgUnit: {
      // still including `orgUnit`...
      select: { name: true }, // ...but only select `name` here
    },
  },
});

/*
  Type of the returned `user` is:
    {
      id: number;
      email: string;
    } & {
      orgUnit: {
        name: string; // <-- no `id` here anymore!
      };
    }
 */
```

Prisma is actively analyzing the function argument and adapting the shape of the return type based on that.

**The goal of this blog post is to understand the main concept of how to achieve such behavior.**  
As you will see, it boils down to

1. Capturing the type of the actual argument with a generic variable.
1. Passing that generic variable to the result type.
1. Introspecting the generic variable to adapt the result type accordingly.

We will now build our own version of `findUniqueOrThrow` demonstrating this concept!
For the sake of simplicity, we will only focus on changing the return type depending on whether `include` is given or not.

## Our first draft: the "least common denominator" approach

Imagine we have to build the type definition for `findUniqueOrThrow` from scratch.  
A good start is to type the return type such that `orgUnit` is optional:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```typescript
function findUniqueOrThrow(args: FindArgs): Promise<FindResult>;

type FindArgs = {
  where: { id: number };
  include?: { orgUnit?: boolean };
};

type FindResult = {
  id: number;
  email: string;
  orgUnit?: { // <-- typed as optional
    id: number;
    name: string;
  };
};
```

This is what I would call the "least common denominator" approach: The property `orgUnit` _can_, but _might not_ be returned, and to represent both these scenarios, this property is optional in `FindResult`.

The downside of this approach is that whenever we use that function, we have to check for `orgUnit` to be present:

```typescript
const userWithOrgUnit = findUniqueOrThrow({
  where: { id: 1 },
  include: { orgUnit: true },
});

/*
 * We know that `orgUnit` is present here because we included it.
 * But the type does not reflect that - the type of `orgUnit` has `undefined` included.
 * That's why TypeScript will throw an error if we try to access properties of `orgUnit` here.
 * Very annoying...
 *
 * To avoid type errors, we must handle `orgUnit` being `undefined` in some way.
 */
if (!userWithOrgUnit.orgUnit) {
  throw new Error('should not happen');
}
// From here on TypeScript will know that accessing properties of `orgUnit` is safe
```

Let's now improve that draft step by step.  
I will use inline comments to highlight what we change.

## Adding generics and conditional types

The first step is easy: change the function signature from this...

```typescript
function findUniqueOrThrow(args: FindArgs): Promise<FindResult>;
```

...to this:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```typescript
function findUniqueOrThrow<T extends FindArgs>( // <-- a new generic variable `T` (with a constraint so that only `FindArgs` are accepted)
  args: T // <-- using that generic variable for `args`
): Promise<FindResult>;
```

At this point, the new generic variable `T` does not really change much.  
Still, there is one important consequence: When calling `findUniqueOrThrow` without specifying `T` explicitly, TypeScript will apply something called _<FancyAnchor href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html#hello-world-of-generics">type argument inference</FancyAnchor>_.
It will infer `T` from the function parameter `args`.  
And that inference will **capture the concrete shape of the actual argument** given! That means whether `include` is present in the function argument will be reflected in the type `T`.

The second step is to pass `T` to the result type. Change this...

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```typescript
function findUniqueOrThrow<T extends FindArgs>(
  args: T
): Promise<FindResult>;

type FindResult = {
  id: number;
  email: string;
  orgUnit?: {
    id: number;
    name: string;
  };
};
```

...to this:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```typescript
function findUniqueOrThrow<T extends FindArgs>(
  args: T
): Promise<FindResult<T>>; // <-- we pass `T` to `FindResult` here

type FindResult<T extends FindArgs> = { // <-- `FindResult` now also takes `T`, the same way as `findUniqueOrThrow` does
  id: number;
  email: string;
  orgUnit?: {
    id: number;
    name: string;
  };
};
```

At this point, `T` is available in the result type `FindResult` but not used yet.

As a final step, we have to introspect `T` and check whether it contains `include: { orgUnit: true }`.

- If it does, we add the property `orgUnit` to the result type.
- If not, we do not add anything.

We can achieve this with a typescript feature called _<FancyAnchor href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html">Conditional Types</FancyAnchor>_.
Conditional types allow us to ask the question "is type `A` assignable to type `B`?" and then continue with one of two branches, whether the answer is "yes" or "no", respectively.

Let's apply conditional types. Change `FindResult` to this:

```typescript
type FindResult<T extends FindArgs> = {
  id: number;
  email: string;
} & (T extends { include: { orgUnit: true } }
  ? {
      orgUnit: {
        id: number;
        name: string;
      };
    }
  : {});
```

We start with including `{ id: number; email: string }` in the result type, because these are the properties of the `User` model, and those properties will be returned for sure.  
It is followed by an ampersand `&` which, in TypeScript, constructs a so-called _<FancyAnchor href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html#intersection-types">Intersection Type</FancyAnchor>_.  
Intersection types allow to add some stuff to existing types.

But what do we add?
Well, we want to add the property `orgUnit` (with its fields) but _only if the org unit was included in the original function call_.  
The conditional type in the code block above does exactly that. Remember, `T` captures _the actual type_ of the function call, and the conditional type checks if `T` is assignable to `{ include: { orgUnit: true } }`.  
Essentially, what we are asking is: "Was the function invoked with an argument containing `{ include: { orgUnit: true } }`?" If the answer is "yes", we add the property `orgUnit` to the result type.  
Otherwise, we add an empty object - which does not change anything of the result type.

...and that's it! We built our own version of `findUniqueOrThrow` which will react to the actual argument given, just like Prisma Client does!

## One last improvement: strictness of the function parameter type

There is one minor aspect left we can improve on: remember when we introduced the generic variable above (instead of using `FindArgs` directly for the function's parameter type), and I said _"At this point, the new generic variable `T` does not really change much."_?  
Actually, there is one little difference: in the old version, using `FindArgs` directly, TypeScript will throw an error if we pass an object literal with unknown properties:

```typescript
function findUniqueOrThrow(args: FindArgs): Promise<FindResult>;

findUniqueOrThrow({
  where: { id: 1 },
  foo: 'bar', // <-- TS error here: "Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'foo' does not exist in type 'FindArgs'"
});
```

Our new solution, on the other hand, will not lead to a compilation error for unknown properties:

```typescript
function findUniqueOrThrow<T extends FindArgs>(args: T): Promise<FindResult<T>>;

findUniqueOrThrow({
  where: { id: 1 },
  foo: 'bar', // <-- no TS error here anymore...
});
```

That's because the only constraint of `T` is that it _extends_ `FindArgs`, and this is the case even if unknown properties are added to the object literal.

From my point of view this is not a big problem.
TypeScript checks for unknown properties only if you pass an object literal directly, but not if it comes from somewhere else and you pass it as a variable.
Thus, we should probably not rely on this check of TypeScript anyways.  
Still, there is a solution to get the error for unknown properties back for our generic function parameter.
It makes use of a helper type called `Subset`:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```typescript
/**
 * Helper type "Subset".
 * @desc From `T` pick properties that exist in `U`. Simple version of Intersection.
 */
type Subset<T, U> = {
  [key in keyof T]: key extends keyof U ? T[key] : never;
};

function findUniqueOrThrow<T extends FindArgs>(
  args: Subset<T, FindArgs> // <-- using `Subset` here
): Promise<FindResult<T>>;

findUniqueOrThrow({
  where: { id: 1 },
  foo: 'bar', // <-- now, we have a TS error again: "Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'never'"
});
```

The error message is not the same, but at least we have an error again.

## But...what should I do with all of that?

I remember situations in which the type of something was `undefined` or `null` and I thought: I know _for sure_ that this thing is defined here, why does TypeScript not know that?  
There is always the "solution" to just throw a non-null assertion (the exclamation mark `!`) at it, but as a good citizen I try to fix the root cause first.  
And the concept we learned in this blog post - the combination of generics and conditional types - can be one tool in our toolbelt to improve the typing of APIs, such that we do not have to resort to any of those nasty quick-fixes!

## Bonus: a glance at the types of Prisma Client

Now that we have learned how all of this works, we can for sure understand the actual types Prisma Client uses!  
It cannot be that complicated, right?

Well...😅

```typescript
function findUniqueOrThrow<T extends UserFindUniqueOrThrowArgs>(
  args?: SelectSubset<T, UserFindUniqueOrThrowArgs>,
): CheckSelect<T, Prisma__UserClient<User>, Prisma__UserClient<UserGetPayload<T>>>;
```

That's a whole bunch of types!

`UserGetPayload` - the equivalent of our `FindResult` type - is also far more complicated than our type...

```typescript
export type UserGetPayload<
  S extends boolean | null | undefined | UserArgs,
  U = keyof S,
> = S extends true
  ? User
  : S extends undefined
    ? never
    : S extends UserArgs | UserFindManyArgs
      ? 'include' extends U
        ? User & {
            [P in TrueKeys<S['include']>]: P extends 'orgUnit'
              ? OrgUnitGetPayload<S['include'][P]>
              : never;
          }
        : 'select' extends U
          ? {
              [P in TrueKeys<S['select']>]: P extends 'orgUnit'
                ? OrgUnitGetPayload<S['select'][P]>
                : P extends keyof User
                  ? User[P]
                  : never;
            }
          : User
      : User;
```

Turns out that these type definitions do all sorts of analysis and type mapping.  
Still, you can see some similarities to our solution.
The biggest difference is that `UserGetPayload` does everything step by step:

1. Extract the keys of `S` in `U`.
1. Check if `include` is in `U`.
1. If so, extract all keys having type `true` of that `include`.
1. Check if one of those keys is `orgUnit`.
1. If so, include `OrgUnitGetPayload` in the result type (which contains, amongst other things, the properties for the `OrgUnit` model).
