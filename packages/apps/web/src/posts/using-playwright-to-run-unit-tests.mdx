I have used Playwright for a couple of my projects so far, and I had such a good experience that it got my E2E test automation tool of choice.

Recently, I started using Playwright Test, the test runner of Playwright ([`@playwright/test`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@playwright/test)) for **unit tests** also.  
This means the test subject **is executed directly**; this differs from the "usual" way of using Playwright to open a browser, navigate to a web page, and test that web page.

In this blog post, I want to

- describe what I like about Playwright and why I think it can be a good choice for unit testing
- outline things missing from Playwright compared to other test frameworks (and how to fill some of those gaps)
- suggest some minor tweaks to make Playwright more suitable for unit tests

## Why to use Playwright Test for unit tests

I had used "traditional" test runners before, mainly Jest, but also Mocha a few years ago.  
I think there are some advantages of using Playwright for unit tests:

- **Same tool for E2E tests and unit tests:**
  One tool less in your setup means one tool less to learn, configure, update, etc.
- **Out-of-the-box support for TypeScript:**
  Playwright Test supports TypeScript _out-of-the-box_.  
  For all other test runners I am aware of you have to configure some transform (Babel, `ts-jest`, etc.), or run the test runner with `ts-node`, or compile the test cases before running them (see e.g. <FancyAnchor href="https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started#using-typescript">"Using Typescript" of the Jest docs</FancyAnchor>).
- **Access to features unique to Playwright:**
  Playwright has some very useful features, e.g.:

  - {/* prettier-ignore */}<FancyAnchor href="https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures">"fixtures"</FancyAnchor> allow to prepare resources per test case on an "opt-in" basis.  
    This is in my opinion much better than the `beforeEach` / `afterEach` fiddling you have to do with other test runners.

    ```typescript
    // base.ts
    import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';
    import * as sinon from 'sinon';

    export const test = base.extend<{ fakeClock: sinon.SinonFakeTimers }>({
      fakeClock: [
        async ({}, use) => {
          const clock = sinon.useFakeTimers();
          await use(clock);
          clock.restore();
        },
        { scope: 'test' },
      ],
    });

    // bar.spec.ts
    import { test } from './base';

    test('with real clock', ({}) => {
      /*
       * this test case does not use the "fakeClock" fixture,
       * thus the fixture does not get set up
       */
    });
    test('with fake clock', ({ fakeClock }) => {
      /*
       * fake timers will get set up for this test case
       * because "fakeClock" fixture is used
       */
    });
    ```

  - {/* prettier-ignore */}<FancyAnchor href="https://playwright.dev/docs/test-advanced#projects">"projects"</FancyAnchor> allow to run "the same or different tests in multiple configurations".  
    For example a while ago I had to make sure that some client/server interaction based on <FancyAnchor href="https://socket.io">socket.io</FancyAnchor> works with both WebSockets and HTTP long-polling.  
    Setting up two Playwright projects with different project parameters allowed me to run the same tests with two configurations, once using WebSockets and once using HTTP long-polling:

    ```typescript
    // playwright.config.ts
    import { PlaywrightTestConfig } from '@playwright/test';

    interface TestOptions {
      transport: 'websocket' | 'polling';
    }

    const config: PlaywrightTestConfig<TestOptions> = {
      projects: [
        {
          name: 'using transport: websocket',
          use: { transport: 'websocket' },
        },
        {
          name: 'using transport: polling',
          use: { transport: 'polling' },
        },
      ],
    };

    export default config;

    // bar.spec.ts
    import { test } from '@playwright/test';

    test('socket.io connection', ({ transport }) => {
      /*
       * this test case will get run twice,
       * with "transport" set once to "websocket" and once to "polling"
       */
      initializeSocket(transport);
      // ...
    });
    ```

- **Development funded by a big company:**
  Playwright is a product of Microsoft and has been maintained very actively over the last couple of years.
- **No use of globals:** Playwright does not use any globals for its test runner.
  You import from `@playwright/test` just what you need in your test files:

  ```typescript
  // bar.spec.ts
  import { expect, test } from '@playwright/test';

  test.describe('describe title', () => {
    test('test title', ({}) => {
      expect(1 + 1).toEqual(2);
    });
  });
  ```

  Compare that to existing test runners like Jest and Mocha (and Cypress, using Mocha under-the-hood).
  Those test runners set up their test functions as globals (`it`, `expect`, `describe`, `beforeEach` etc.).  
  In TypeScript projects, as soon as you install any two of these test libraries you end up with TypeScript compilation errors, since the types of those functions are usually not compatible with each other.
  There are a couple of workarounds to avoid those compilation errors, for example fiddling with `tsconfig.json` such that types of these libraries are excluded or just disable type checking of libraries altogether (`skipLibCheck: true`).  
  Cypress even has a guide dedicated to this problem (<FancyAnchor href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/typescript-support">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>).

  Having the same Playwright Test import statements in every test file might be some boilerplate, but I think the reduced friction (by not having any globals) justifies that boilerplate.

## Things missing from Playwright (and how to fill the gaps)

Compared to Jest, there are some things missing from Playwright Test which are often needed when running unit tests.  
Most of those things can be substituted by using libraries of the Node.js ecosystem.  
Take a look at <FancyAnchor href="https://github.com/pkerschbaum/blog-playwright-for-unit-tests_example">the example repository I made</FancyAnchor> to see how to set up those things!

- **Mocks & Spies:**
  Use [`sinon`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sinon) or [`jest-mock`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-mock) (the mocking solution shipped with Jest).
- **Fake timers:**
  Use [`sinon`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sinon) (<FancyAnchor href="https://github.com/pkerschbaum/blog-playwright-for-unit-tests_example/compare/code-coverage...fake-timers">See code changes</FancyAnchor>).
- **Code coverage:**
  A simple setup using the command-line interface [`nyc`](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) of Istanbul (a code coverage tool for JavaScript) and [`source-map-support`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-support) does the job (<FancyAnchor href="https://github.com/pkerschbaum/blog-playwright-for-unit-tests_example/compare/base-setup...code-coverage">See code changes</FancyAnchor>).
- **Watch mode:**
  Not supported but "planned work" at the time of writing: <FancyAnchor href="https://playwright.dev/docs/test-components#planned-work">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>.  
  There are some workarounds in the related issue: <FancyAnchor href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/7035">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>.
- **CommonJS/ES module mocking:**
  Jest provides a way to mock CommonJS modules via `jest.mock`, and support for ESM is on its way at the time of writing: <FancyAnchor href="https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/10025">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>.  
  Unfortunately, Node.js module mocking libraries like [`testdouble`](https://github.com/testdouble/testdouble.js) don't work for Playwright because it does some of the module loading itself (<FancyAnchor href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/14398">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>).  
  If you want to get module mocking support in Playwright, you can upvote this feature request: <FancyAnchor href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/14572">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>.

  This is the biggest downside of using Playwright for unit tests in my opinion.  
  For now, if you want to test modules isolated from others you have to adapt the codebase to use some kind of dependency injection.
  Be it that dependencies are just passed as arguments when calling functions, or using a dependency injection solution like <FancyAnchor href="https://docs.nestjs.com/standalone-applications">NestJS IoC containers</FancyAnchor> (which I have used very successfully in the past).

## Other things to consider

**Snapshot Suffix:**
Playwright Test has a method `expect(...).toMatchSnapshot(...)` which can perform snapshot-comparisons on screenshots but also textual and binary data.  
 At the time of writing, Playwright will append a platform-specific suffix to the name of the file the snapshot is stored in.
This makes sense for screenshots (since screenshots taken on differend platforms will deviate slightly, for example because of text rendering), but usually it does not make sense in case of textual/binary data.

This is an open issue (<FancyAnchor href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/11134">AUTOGENERATE</FancyAnchor>), for now we can disable the suffix by setting up an "auto-fixture" and override `testInfo.snapshotSuffix`:

```typescript
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';

export const test = base.extend<{ _autoSnapshotSuffix: void }>({
  _autoSnapshotSuffix: [
    async ({}, use, testInfo) => {
      testInfo.snapshotSuffix = '';
      await use();
    },
    { auto: true },
  ],
});
```
